<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This project presents a systematic comparative study of classical machine learning 
approaches for binary news text classification. The objective was to classify news 
articles into <b>Sports</b> and <b>Politics</b> categories using two datasets with 
distinct characteristics: the BBC News dataset (clean, well-structured) and the 
AG News dataset (large-scale and diverse).
</p>

<p>
The study evaluates model performance, robustness, and generalization across 
datasets that differ in size, lexical overlap, writing style, and domain variability. 
Three supervised learning models — Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, 
and Linear Support Vector Machine — were trained using TF-IDF features. 
Performance was analyzed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

<h2>📂 Dataset Description & Collection</h2>

<h3>1. BBC News Dataset</h3>
<p>
The BBC dataset contains professionally written news articles organized in 
separate directories by topic. Only two categories were selected: Sports and Politics.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Total Articles: 928</li>
<li>Sports: 511 articles</li>
<li>Politics: 417 articles</li>
<li>Format: Plain text files</li>
</ul>

<p>
This dataset is relatively clean, well-separated, and domain-specific, making 
it suitable for controlled experimentation.
</p>

<h3>2. AG News Dataset</h3>
<p>
The AG News dataset is a large-scale news corpus in CSV format containing 
four categories. For this study, only:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Class 1 (World) → Relabelled as Politics</li>
<li>Class 2 (Sports)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Approximately 11,400 filtered samples were used. Articles consist of short 
titles and descriptions, increasing lexical ambiguity and classification complexity.
</p>

</div>

<!-- ================================================= -->
<div class="card">
<h2>Comparative Dataset Analysis</h2>

<p>
The BBC dataset demonstrates strong lexical separation between domains. 
Sports articles contain domain-specific terminology such as 
<i>"match", "league", "coach", "season"</i>, whereas political articles 
include terms like <i>"government", "election", "minister", "policy"</i>.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, AG News articles are shorter and exhibit higher vocabulary overlap. 
For example, words such as <i>"team", "campaign", "leader"</i> may appear in both 
sports and political contexts. This overlap increases decision boundary complexity.
</p>

<p>
Therefore:
</p>

<ul>
<li>BBC represents a <b>clean, separable classification scenario</b>.</li>
<li>AG News represents a <b>real-world, noisy classification scenario</b>.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<h3>1. Text Preprocessing</h3>
<p>
Text preprocessing is a crucial step in any Natural Language Processing pipeline. 
Raw textual data often contains inconsistencies, noise, and non-informative tokens 
that may negatively impact model performance.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Lowercasing:</b> All text was converted to lowercase to ensure that words such as 
"Government" and "government" are treated as identical features.</li>

<li><b>Stopword Removal:</b> Common words such as "the", "is", and "and" were removed 
using built-in English stopword lists. These words carry little discriminative value 
for topic classification.</li>

<li><b>No Stemming/Lemmatization:</b> Stemming was intentionally not applied in order 
to preserve interpretability and avoid distortion of meaningful domain-specific words 
(e.g., "election" vs "elect").</li>
</ul>

<p>
These preprocessing steps reduce vocabulary size and improve computational efficiency 
while maintaining important domain signals.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. Feature Extraction: TF-IDF Representation</h3>

<p>
Text documents cannot be directly processed by machine learning algorithms. 
Therefore, they must be converted into numerical feature vectors. 
This study uses <b>Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)</b>.
</p>

<p>
TF-IDF balances two important aspects:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Term Frequency (TF):</b> Measures how often a word appears in a document.</li>
<li><b>Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):</b> Reduces weight of words that appear in many documents.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Mathematically:
</p>

<p>
TF-IDF(word) = TF(word, document) × log(Total Documents / Documents containing word)
</p>

<p>
Advantages of TF-IDF:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduces dominance of very common words.</li>
<li>Emphasizes discriminative topic-specific terms.</li>
<li>Produces sparse, high-dimensional representations suitable for linear models.</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, TF-IDF does not capture semantic relationships or word order.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. Models Evaluated</h3>

<h4>3.1 Multinomial Naive Bayes (Generative Model)</h4>

<p>
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem with a 
conditional independence assumption between features.
</p>

<p>
It calculates:
</p>

<p>
P(Class | Document) ∝ P(Class) × Π P(Word | Class)
</p>

<p>
Advantages:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Extremely fast and efficient.</li>
<li>Performs well on high-dimensional sparse data.</li>
<li>Strong baseline for text classification.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Limitations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Assumes word independence (often unrealistic).</li>
<li>Struggles when features are highly correlated.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this project, Naive Bayes performs perfectly on BBC but slightly lower on AG News, 
indicating sensitivity to overlapping vocabulary.
</p>

<hr>

<h4>3.2 Logistic Regression (Discriminative Linear Model)</h4>

<p>
Logistic Regression is a linear classifier that directly models the posterior probability 
P(Class | Features) using a sigmoid function.
</p>

<p>
It optimizes log-loss (cross-entropy loss) to find the best decision boundary.
</p>

<p>
Advantages:
</p>

<ul>
<li>No independence assumption.</li>
<li>Handles correlated features better than Naive Bayes.</li>
<li>Produces well-calibrated probabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Limitations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Still linear — cannot capture non-linear relationships.</li>
<li>Performance depends heavily on feature representation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy on AG News, suggesting 
better robustness in noisy and overlapping scenarios.
</p>

<hr>

<h4>3.3 Support Vector Machine (Margin-Based Classifier)</h4>

<p>
Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) attempts to find the optimal hyperplane 
that maximizes the margin between classes.
</p>

<p>
Rather than modeling probabilities, SVM focuses on maximizing class separation.
</p>

<p>
Advantages:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Highly effective in high-dimensional sparse spaces.</li>
<li>Robust against overfitting in text classification tasks.</li>
<li>Often outperforms probabilistic models in NLP tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Limitations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Does not provide probability outputs by default.</li>
<li>Can be computationally expensive for very large datasets.</li>
</ul>

<p>
SVM performed very competitively across both datasets, confirming 
its suitability for text classification.

<th>Strength</th>
<th>Weakness</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Naive Bayes</td>
<td>Generative</td>
<td>Fast, simple, strong baseline</td>

<td>No probability output</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Overall, results indicate that:
</p>

<ul>
<li>When classes are clearly separable (BBC), all linear models perform equally well.</li>
<li>When lexical overlap increases (AG News), discriminative models (Logistic Regression, SVM) show slight advantages.</li>
<li>Feature representation (TF-IDF) plays a critical role in overall performance.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>5. Evaluation Strategy</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>BBC Dataset:</b> 80–20 stratified train-test split to maintain class balance.</li>
<li><b>AG News:</b> Predefined train-test split used to ensure standardized evaluation.</li>
<li><b>Metrics:</b> Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Accuracy provides overall correctness, while Precision and Recall evaluate 
class-specific performance. F1-score balances both, especially important 
in slightly imbalanced datasets.

<h2>Experimental Results</h2>

<h3>BBC Dataset Results</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Model</th><th>Accuracy</th></tr>
<tr><td>Naive Bayes</td><td>1.000</td></tr>
<tr><td>Logistic Regression</td><td>1.000</td></tr>
<tr><td>SVM</td><td>1.000</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
All models achieved perfect accuracy due to strong lexical separation 
between categories. The decision boundary is nearly linearly separable 
in TF-IDF space.
</p>

<h3>AG News Dataset Results</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Model</th><th>Accuracy</th></tr>
<tr><td>Naive Bayes</td><td>0.9739</td></tr>
<tr><td>Logistic Regression</td><td>0.9774</td></tr>
<tr><td>SVM</td><td>0.9761</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Performance slightly decreased compared to BBC due to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Shorter article length</li>
<li>Vocabulary overlap</li>
<li>Context ambiguity</li>
</ul>

<p>
Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy, suggesting that 
discriminative models better handle overlapping feature distributions.

<h2>Discussion & Interpretation</h2>

<p>
The results demonstrate that classical machine learning models remain 
highly effective for structured topic classification tasks. 
However, dataset characteristics significantly impact performance.
</p>

<ul>
<li>BBC dataset confirms near-linear separability.</li>
<li>AG dataset demonstrates real-world ambiguity challenges.</li>
<li>Logistic Regression slightly outperforms due to discriminative optimization.</li>
<li>SVM performs consistently strong due to margin maximization.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The minimal difference between models suggests that feature representation 
(TF-IDF) plays a more critical role than classifier complexity for this task.

<li>Domain shift between datasets affects generalization.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<!-- ================================================= -->

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Incorporate Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).</li>

<div class="card">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
This comparative study demonstrates that traditional linear classifiers 
combined with TF-IDF remain strong baselines for news topic classification. 
While performance is near-perfect in clean datasets, real-world data introduces 
ambiguity that slightly reduces accuracy.
</p>

<p>
The findings emphasize the importance of dataset characteristics, feature 
engineering, and model selection when designing text classification systems.
